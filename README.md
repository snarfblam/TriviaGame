Trivia quiz game written in html/javascript. Features a gentler, kinder "normal mode" as well as a "millionaire mode" that gives out imaginary money like it's going out of style. Oh, there are some folders:
 - /**assets** - Contains everything that isn't index.html
   - /**css** - css files
   - /**images** - UI images
     - /**answers** - Images to go along with the informative text following each questions
   - /**js** - All javascript files (there is only one!)
